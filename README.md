# Overview

### What problem is this project trying to solve?

One of the biggest challenges of being a DM is dealing with the huge amount of information that you have to create and remember. This can often be very overwhelming, and if things are not well organized, then it can also be very time consuming. This project aims to make it easier for DMs to manage the content of their campaigns, hopefully reducing the complexity of keeping track of every aspect of the campaign and reducing the amount of time needed for preparation.

### How is this project going to solve the problem?

By providing an easy-to-use, well-organized interface for running and managing D&D 5th Edition campaigns. Creating content will be simple and flexible, keeping the many aspects of a campaign--PCs, NPCs, monsters, locations, encounters, items, etc.--as decoupled from each other as possible so as to maximize resuability and minimize repition of the same information. At the same time, the many aspects of a campaign will be able to be linked together, making it easy to keep track of how everything is related, and giving a clear history of the progression of the campaign. Above all, information should be easy to find and pleasant to view.
